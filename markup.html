      <h1>Markup</h1>
      <p>HTML markup consists of several key components, including those called tags (and their attributes), character-based data types, character references and entity references. HTML tags most commonly come in pairs like <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>
        and <code>&lt;/h1&gt;</code>, although some represent empty elements and so are unpaired, for example <code>&lt;img&gt;</code>. The first tag in such a pair is the start tag, and the second is the end tag (they are also called opening tags
        and closing tags). </p>
      <p>Another important component is the HTML document type declaration, which triggers standards mode rendering.</p>
      <p>The following is an example of the classic "Hello, World!" program:</p>
      <div class="code container"><code>
          <p>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</p>
          <p>&lt;html&gt;</p>
          <p>&lt;head&gt;</p>
          <p>&lt;title&gt;This is a title&lt;/title&gt;</p>
          <p>&lt;/head&gt;</p>
          <p>&lt;body&gt;</p>
          <p>&lt;p&gt;Hello world!&lt;/p&gt;</p>
          <p>&lt;/body&gt;</p>
          <p>&lt;/html&gt;</p>
        </code></div>
      <p>The text between <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;/html&gt;</code> describes the web page, and the text between <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;/body&gt;</code> is the visible page content. The markup text
        <code>&lt;title&gt;This is a title&lt;/title&gt;</code> defines the browser page title.</p>
      <p>The Document Type Declaration <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</code> is for HTML5. If a declaration is not included, various browsers will revert to "quirks mode" for rendering.</p>
      <h2>Elements</h2>
      <p>HTML documents imply a structure of nested HTML elements. These are indicated in the document by HTML tags, enclosed in angle brackets thus: <code>&lt;p&gt;</code>.</p>
      <p>In the simple, general case, the extent of an element is indicated by a pair of tags: a "start tag" <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> and "end tag" <code>&lt;/p&gt;</code>. The text content of the element, if any, is placed between these tags. </p>
      <p>Tags may also enclose further tag markup between the start and end, including a mixture of tags and text. This indicates further (nested) elements, as children of the parent element.</p>
      <p>The start tag may also include <em>attributes</em> within the tag. These indicate other information, such as identifiers for sections within the document, identifiers used to bind style information to the presentation of the document, and
        for some tags such as the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> used to embed images, the reference to the image resource. </p>
      <p>Some elements, such as the line break <code>&lt;br&gt;</code>, do not permit any embedded content, either text or further tags. These require only a single empty tag (akin to a start tag) and do not use an end tag.</p>
      <p>Many tags, particularly the closing end tag for the very commonly used paragraph element <code>&lt;p&gt;</code>, are optional. An HTML browser or other agent can infer the closure for the end of an element from the context and the structural
        rules defined by the HTML standard. These rules are complex and not widely understood by most HTML coders.</p>
      <p>The general form of an HTML element is therefore: <code>&lt;tag attribute1="value1" attribute2="value2"&gt;''content''&lt;/tag&gt;</code>. Some HTML elements are defined as empty elements and take the form <code>&lt;tag attribute1="value1"
          attribute2="value2"&gt;</code>. Empty elements may enclose no content, for instance, the <code>&lt;br&gt;</code> tag or the inline <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag. The name of an HTML element is the name used in the tags. Note that the end
        tag's name is preceded by a slash character, /, and that in empty elements the end tag is neither required nor allowed. If attributes are not mentioned, default values are used in each case. </p>
      <h3>Element examples</h3>
      <p>Header of the HTML document: <code>&lt;head&gt;...&lt;/head&gt;</code>. The title is included in the head, for example:</p>
      <div class="code container"><code>
          <p>&lt;head&gt;</p>
          <p>&lt;title&gt;The Title&lt;/title&gt;</p>
          <p>&lt;/head&gt;</p>
        </code></div>
      <p>Headings: HTML headings are defined with the <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> to <code>&lt;h6&gt;</code> tags with H1 being the highest (or most important) level and H6 the least:</p>
      <div class="code container"><code>
          <p>&lt;h1&gt;Heading level 1&lt;/h1&gt;</p>
          <p>&lt;h2&gt;Heading level 2&lt;/h2&gt;</p>
          <p>&lt;h3&gt;Heading level 3&lt;/h3&gt;</p>
          <p>&lt;h4&gt;Heading level 4&lt;/h4&gt;</p>
          <p>&lt;h5&gt;Heading level 5&lt;/h5&gt;</p>
          <p>&lt;h6&gt;Heading level 6&lt;/h6&gt;</p>
        </code></div>
      <p>Paragraphs:</p>
      <div class="code container"><code>
          <p>&lt;p&gt;Paragraph 1&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Paragraph 2&lt;/p&gt;</p>
        </code></div>
      <p>Line breaks: <code>&lt;br&gt;</code>. The difference between <code>&lt;br&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> is that br breaks a line without altering the semantic structure of the page, whereas p sections the page into paragraphs. Note
        also that br is an empty element in that, although it may have attributes, it can take no content and it may not have an end tag.</p>
      <div class="code container"><code>
          <p>&lt;p&gt;This &lt;br&gt; is a paragraph &lt;br&gt; with &lt;br&gt; line breaks&lt;/p&gt;</p>
        </code></div>
      <p>This is a link in HTML. To create a link the <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> tag is used. The href attribute holds the URL address of the link. </p>
      <div class="code container"><code>
          <p>&lt;a href="https://www.wikipedia.org/"&gt;A link to Wikipedia!&lt;/a&gt;</p>
        </code></div>
      <p>Inputs:</p>
      <p>There are many possible ways a user can give input/s like:</p>
      <div class="code container"><code>
          <p>&lt;input type="text" /&gt; &lt;!-- This is for text input --&gt;</p>
          <p>&lt;input type="file" /&gt; &lt;!-- This is for uploading files --&gt;</p>
          <p>&lt;input type="checkbox" /&gt; &lt;!-- This is for checkboxes --&gt;</p>
        </code></div>
      <p>Comments:</p>
      <div class="code container"><code>
          <p>&lt;!-- This is a comment --&gt;</p>
        </code></div>
      <p>Comments can help in the understanding of the markup and do not display in the webpage.</p>
      <p>There are several types of markup elements used in HTML:</p>
      <h4>Structural markup indicates the purpose of text</h4>
      <p>For example, <code>&lt;h2&gt;Golf&lt;/h2&gt;</code> establishes "Golf" as a second-level heading. Structural markup does not denote any specific rendering, but most web browsers have default styles for element formatting. Content may be
        further styled using Cascading Style Sheets (CSS).</p>
      <h4>Presentational markup indicates the appearance of the text, regardless of its purpose</h4>
      <p>For example, <code>&lt;b&gt;boldface&lt;/b&gt;</code> indicates that visual output devices should render "boldface" in bold text, but gives little indication what devices that are unable to do this (such as aural devices that read the text
        aloud) should do. In the case of both <code>&lt;b&gt;bold&lt;/b&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;i>italic&lt;/i&gt;</code>, there are other elements that may have equivalent visual renderings but that are more semantic in nature, such as
        <code>&lt;strong&gt;strong text&lt;/strong&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;em&gt;emphasized text&lt;/em&gt;</code> respectively. It is easier to see how an aural user agent should interpret the latter two elements. However, they are not equivalent
        to their presentational counterparts: it would be undesirable for a screen-reader to emphasize the name of a book, for instance, but on a screen such a name would be italicized. Most presentational markup elements have become deprecated under
        the HTML 4.0 specification in favor of using CSS for styling.</p>
      <h4>Hypertext markup makes parts of a document into links to other documents</h4>
      <p>An anchor element creates a hyperlink in the document and its href attribute sets the link's target URL. For example, the HTML markup <code>&lt;a href="https://www.google.com/"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;</code>, will render the word "Wikipedia"
        as a hyperlink. To render an image as a hyperlink, an img element is inserted as content into the a element. Like br, img is an empty element with attributes but no content or closing tag. <code>&lt;a href="https://example.org"&gt;&lt;img
          src="image.gif" alt="descriptive text" width="50" height="50" border="0">&lt;/a&gt;</code>.</p>
      <h4>Attributes</h4>
      <p>Most of the attributes of an element are name-value pairs, separated by = and written within the start tag of an element after the element's name. The value may be enclosed in single or double quotes, although values consisting of certain
        characters can be left unquoted in HTML (but not XHTML). Leaving attribute values unquoted is considered unsafe. In contrast with name-value pair attributes, there are some attributes that affect the element simply by their presence in the
        start tag of the element, like the ismap attribute for the img element.</p>
      <p>There are several common attributes that may appear in many elements :</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The id attribute provides a document-wide unique identifier for an element. This is used to identify the element so that stylesheets can alter its presentational properties, and scripts may alter, animate or delete its contents or
          presentation. Appended to the URL of the page, it provides a globally unique identifier for the element, typically a sub-section of the page. For example, the ID "Attributes" in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML#Attributes.</li>
        <li>The class attribute provides a way of classifying similar elements. This can be used for semantic or presentation purposes. For example, an HTML document might semantically use the designation <code>&lt;class="notation"&gt;</code> to
          indicate that all elements with this class value are subordinate to the main text of the document. In presentation, such elements might be gathered together and presented as footnotes on a page instead of appearing in the place where they
          occur in the HTML source. Class attributes are used semantically in microformats. Multiple class values may be specified; for example <code>&lt;class="notation important"&gt;</code> puts the element into both the notation and the important
          classes.</li>
        <li>An author may use the style attribute to assign presentational properties to a particular element. It is considered better practice to use an element's id or class attributes to select the element from within a stylesheet, though
          sometimes this can be too cumbersome for a simple, specific, or ad hoc styling.</li>
        <li>The title attribute is used to attach subtextual explanation to an element. In most browsers this attribute is displayed as a tooltip.</li>
        <li>The lang attribute identifies the natural language of the element's contents, which may be different from that of the rest of the document. For example, in an English-language document:
          <div class="code container"><code>
              <p>&lt;p&gt;Oh well, &lt;span lang="fr"&gt;c'est la vie&lt;/span&gt;, as they say in France.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
            </code></div>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>The abbreviation element, abbr, can be used to demonstrate some of these attributes:</p>
      <div class="code container"><code>
          <p>&lt;abbr id="anId" class="jargon" style="color:purple;" title="Hypertext Markup Language"&gt;HTML&lt;/abbr&gt;</p>
        </code></div>
      <p>This example displays as HTML; in most browsers, pointing the cursor at the abbreviation should display the title text "Hypertext Markup Language." </p>
      <p>Most elements take the language-related attribute dir to specify text direction, such as with "rtl" for right-to-left text in, for example, Arabic, Persian or Hebrew.</p>
      <h2>Character and entity references</h2>
      <p>As of version 4.0, HTML defines a set of 252 character entity references and a set of 1,114,050 numeric character references, both of which allow individual characters to be written via simple markup, rather than literally. A literal
        character and its markup counterpart are considered equivalent and are rendered identically.</p>
      <h2>Data types</h2>
      <p>HTML defines several data types for element content, such as script data and stylesheet data, and a plethora of types for attribute values, including IDs, names, URIs, numbers, units of length, languages, media descriptors, colors, character
        encodings, dates and times, and so on. All of these data types are specializations of character data.</p>
      <h2>Document type declaration</h2>
      <p>HTML documents are required to start with a Document Type Declaration (informally, a "doctype"). In browsers, the doctype helps to define the rendering mode—particularly whether to use quirks mode.</p>
      <p>The original purpose of the doctype was to enable parsing and validation of HTML documents by SGML tools based on the Document Type Definition (DTD). The DTD to which the DOCTYPE refers contains a machine-readable grammar specifying the
        permitted and prohibited content for a document conforming to such a DTD. Browsers, on the other hand, do not implement HTML as an application of SGML and by consequence do not read the DTD.</p>
      <p>HTML5 does not define a DTD; therefore, in HTML5 the doctype declaration is simpler and shorter:</p>
      <div class="code container"><code>
          <p>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</p>
        </code></div>
      <p>An example of an HTML 4 doctype:</p>
      <div class="code container"><code>
          <p>&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN" "https://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd"&gt;</p>
        </code></div>
      <p>This declaration references the DTD for the "strict" version of HTML 4.01. SGML-based validators read the DTD in order to properly parse the document and to perform validation. In modern browsers, a valid doctype activates standards mode as
        opposed to quirks mode.</p>
      <p>In addition, HTML 4.01 provides Transitional and Frameset DTDs, as explained below. Transitional type is the most inclusive, incorporating current tags as well as older or "deprecated" tags, with the Strict DTD excluding deprecated tags.
        Frameset has all tags necessary to make frames on a page along with the tags included in transitional type.</p>
