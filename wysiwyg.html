    <h2>WYSIWYG Editors</h2>
      <p>There are some WYSIWYG editors (What You See Is What You Get), in which the user lays out everything as it is to appear in the HTML document using a graphical user interface (GUI), often similar to word processors. The editor renders the document rather than show the code, so authors do not require extensive knowledge of HTML.</p>

      <p>The WYSIWYG editing model has been criticized, primarily because of the low quality of the generated code; there are voices advocating a change to the WYSIWYM model (What You See Is What You Mean).</p>

      <p>WYSIWYG editors remain a controversial topic because of their perceived flaws such as:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Relying mainly on layout as opposed to meaning, often using markup that does not convey the intended meaning but simply copies the layout.</li>
        <li>Often producing extremely verbose and redudant code that fails to make use of the cascading nature of HTML and CSS.</li>
        <li>Often producing ungrammatical markup, called tag soup or semantically incorrect markup (such as &lt;em&gt; for italics).</li>
        <li>As a great deal of the information in HTML documents is not in the layout, the model has been criticized for its "what you see is all you get"-nature.</li>
      </ul>
